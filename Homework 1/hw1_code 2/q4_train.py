# Trains the regularized least squares regression model using the closed form 
# solution given the training data X, Y.
#
# INPUT:
#  X: a numpy.ndarray matrix of size [m x d] and type 'float' where each row 
#     is a d-dimensional input example
#  Y: a numpy.ndarray vector of size [m x 1] and type 'float', where the 
#     i-th element is the correct output value for the i-th input example. 
#  lambda: 'float' regularization hyperparameter
#  mode: specifies the type of features; 
#        it is a 'str' that can be either 'linear' or 'quadratic'.
#
# OUTPUT:
#  theta: a numpy.ndarray vector of size [n x 1] and type 'float'
#         containing the learned model parameters.
